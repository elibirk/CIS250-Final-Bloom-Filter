# CIS250-Final-Bloom-Filter
Implementation and test of a bloom filter data structure in Java.

BloomFilter.java is the implementation itself and BloomTest.java is the main class to show the bloom filter's functionality. User enters as many terms into the bloom filter as desired, then queries the filter to test it. Negative results are absolute, positive results only indicate the possibility of the entry.
